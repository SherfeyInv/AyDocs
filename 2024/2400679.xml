<AbstractNarration>The Meet the New Faculty Candidates Poster Session as part of the Materials Research Societyâ€™s 2023 Fall Meeting in Boston, scheduled for November 29, 2023 provides a unique opportunity for early career professionals and graduate students interested in applying to faculty positions to connect with one another and receive feedback on giving successful interviews and writing research and teaching statements. It also enables recruiters and search committees to identify potential new faculty members. The poster session is organized by The Early Career Professionals Subcommittee (ECPSC) Materials Research Society (MRS). Previous sessions have witnessed participation ranging from 70 to 100 attendees. This year's MRS Fall meeting will commemorate the 5th anniversary of this impactful poster session which further highlights its&lt;br/&gt;intellectual merits and impact within the community. Attendees come from a broad spectrum of materials research subareas, thus providing a means for interdisciplinary communication that will foster new research ideas and collaborations. This award will increase participation in this meeting by defraying the cost of registration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
