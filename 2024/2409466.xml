<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Computational techniques have enabled many advances in the bio and medical sciences, advancing national health and contributing to the prosperity and welfare of society at large. Great advances in bio and medical sciences are possible only if scientists from the computation, basic research, and medical research communities come together. The International Conference on Computational Advances in Bio and Medical Sciences (ICCABS) has the goal of bringing together these communities and serving as a collaboration platform. Eleven offerings of ICCABS have been successfully completed and this award supports the 12th edition. Anticipated results of this effort are for scientists to cultivate opportunities for collaborative efforts and the emergence of innovative approaches to address complex bio and medical issues. Additionally, graduate and undergraduate students supported will meet and listen to experts, as well as attend three keynote talks from world class scientists and several invited speakers. The fellows and colleagues of the attending students will also benefit when attendees return and communicate the experience at their home institutions. The conference proceedings from the meeting will be of great use to students, researchers, and practitioners. Portions of the proceedings will also be used in different courses. Selected conference papers will be used to develop two special issues in the Journal of Computational Biology and the Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference covers a wide range of topics including: (1) recent opportunities and challenges in new sequencing technologies (2) deep learning and biomedical imaging and (3) applications of computational advances in biomedical research. Altogether, this three-day conference supports students, researchers, and practitioners who want to gain key insight into a wide range of current computational advances unfolding in the bio and medical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
