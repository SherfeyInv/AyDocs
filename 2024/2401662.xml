<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Southern Regional Algebra Conference (SRAC). The SRAC is a yearly weekend conference that has been in existence since 1988. Its first edition was held at the University of Southern Mississippi in the Spring of 1988. This spring the SRAC will be held at the University of Houston-Downtown, March 22-24, 2024. The SRAC brings together mathematicians that carry out research in the area of algebra and closely related areas for a full weekend of lectures, short presentations and discussions. The conference attracts researchers from many undergraduate institutions in the Gulf Coast Region that usually do not have sufficient funding to support their research activities, especially long-distance meetings. It is also an important platform for graduate students and early career mathematicians to present their research in algebra and be exposed to a community of algebraists outside their respective home institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main themes of the conference are Lie/Leibniz Algebras and their representation theory; and the theory of nearrings and other generalizations of rings.  On Friday March 22, there will be a single session on topics in algebra that lie either at the intersection of two themes of the conference or outside of their union. On Saturday March 23, the conference will begin with an hour-long plenary session on Leibniz algebras and the rest of the day will be split into two parallel sessions of 25-min talks, with each session focusing on one of the main themes. On Sunday March 24, the conference will start with an hour-long plenary session on the near-rings theory, and the rest of the morning will be split into two parallel sessions of 25-min talks, with each session focusing on one of the main themes. There will be plenty of opportunity for informal follow-up discussions. Further information is available at the conference website:&lt;br/&gt;https://www.uhd.edu/academics/sciences/mathematics-statistics/southern-regional-algebra-conference.aspx&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
