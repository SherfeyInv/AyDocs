<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of zero-emissions alternatives to fuel planes, trains, trucks, buses, ships, and off-road and cargo handling equipment. Currently, clean fuels, such as hydrogen or hydrogen-derived fuels, lack existing distribution and storage infrastructure creating major hurdles to adoption. The proposed technology uses on-board generation of hydrogen to provide a viable alternative to existing battery electric technology that cannot serve certain segments of the heavy-duty vehicle fleet due to weight or operating conditions.  The goal is to provide zero emissions fuel independence for places that are currently reliant on expensive diesel and gasoline deliveries, and may be underserved by newer, cleaner fuel supply chains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a two-step water electrolysis approach to produce hydrogen on-board a vehicle.   The proposed technology is designed to provide a safer alternative to battery electric technology and solve one of the pressing challenges of using hydrogen as a transportation fuel, which is moving and storing hydrogen.  In addition, the system has a total gravimetric energy density, including the fuel cell, two- to three-times that of commercially available lithium-based battery technologies.  The proposed technology uses activated zinc (Zn) in the first step of the process that produces hydrogen gas and zinc oxide when in contact with water and does not require electricity.  In step two, electricity is used to electrochemically convert the zinc oxide solid by-product back to activated zinc.  This&lt;br/&gt;closed-loop two-step water splitting process is referred to as an electrochemical zinc/zinc oxide cycle. The same activated zinc may be used to produce H2 on-site multiple times using many zinc/zinc oxide cycles, which makes it more cost-effective than current solutions. The activated zinc may be used to produce clean H2 off-grid, off-peak, or on-board a vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
